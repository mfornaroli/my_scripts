Train an Image Classifier with TensorFlow for Poets - Machine Learning Recipes #6

tensor flow for poet
classifier distinguishing 5 types of flowers
5 directories, each for one type of flower.
trining data.
training classifier >> tensorFlow (deep learning)
major advantage: you dont need to extrat features manually. 
classifier will do it. 
TF Learn. high level library built on top of tensor flow.
Inception (one of Googles best image classifier) (trained on 1 milion images)
we need diversity and quantity, to train an image classifier. 

Gini impurity: probability that, given a dataset (and corresponding labels), if you
assign randomly a label to an element, it's not labelled correctly. 
uniform set: index will be zero. 

information gain: weighted avg of variation in gini index

each node: consider the features you have in your dataset, 
ask a yes/no question; pick the question that gives highest
information gain, then split dataset.
